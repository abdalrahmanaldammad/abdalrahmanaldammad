# 👋 Hi, I'm Abdul Rahman Al-Dammad

🎓 I'm a 4th-year IT student with a deep passion for building modern backend systems using **Spring Boot** and **microservices architecture**.

💡 I’m especially interested in:
- Microservice design patterns and distributed systems
- Event-driven architectures using **Kafka** and **RabbitMQ**
- Building cloud-native applications with **Spring Cloud**
- Exploring DevOps practices and tools

🌱 While I have solid experience with:
- **Spring Boot**, **Spring Cloud**, and **Spring Security**
- RESTful APIs using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **NestJS (basics)**
- Frontend development with **React.js**

🚀 My future goal is to become a **DevOps Engineer**, but first I’m focused on mastering:
- Advanced Spring Boot microservices
- Event-driven design
- Real-world backend development experience

☁️ I plan to dive into **AWS** and cloud technologies as my next step.
